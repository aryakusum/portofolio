# Architecture

## High-Level Pattern

- **Component-Based UI:** React functional components used throughout.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** Single Page Application generated by Vite.

## Core Layers

- **Entry Points:**
  - `index.html` → `src/main.jsx` → `src/App.jsx`.
- **State Management:** React Context API (`src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`) and local state (`useState`, `useRef`).
- **Data Layer:** Static exports inside `src/data.js` (e.g., `listTools`, `listProyek`).
- **Routing/Navigation:** No complex routing (react-router-dom) is used; views are conditionally rendered based on internal state (e.g., toggling between `EditorialContent` and `RetroContent`).

## Notable Abstractions

- **Theme Switching Strategy:** The app manages a global theme (`editorial` vs. `retro`) which flips out the core content components.
- **3D Components:** Isolated inside specific component subfolders (`three`, `Scene3D`) relying heavily on `@react-three/fiber` for a modular 3D pipeline.
